            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p class="firstpara"><strong class="firstcharacter">I</strong>t is not a normal Joburg sighting for a 64-year-old man like me to be seen around carrying the camera, especially in the poorer neighborhoods of Johannesburg. If only creatives could break free beyond these stereotypical boundaries. If only we could understand that gaming, photography, and dancing are not hobbies, but a means of professionally curating arts.</p> 
            <p>Alice Mann, a renowned South African photographer captured the all-female drummies, as an effort to zoom the lens to South Africa’s underprivileged communities “This is part of my ongoing work exploring notions of femininity and empowerment in modern society,” Mann explains. “With my continued investigation into this subculture, I hope that these images can communicate the pride and confidence these girls have achieved through identifying as ‘drummies,’ in a context where they face many social challenges.”</p>

            <img src="./images/creativity.jpeg" />
            <p class="firstpara"><strong class="firstcharacter">W</strong>hy did it seem natural for black South Africans to invite and allow Alice to take pictures in their community, and not fellow black photographers? I have been asked so many questions even on free fall shoots. Questions like “So what are you using the photos for?” Maybe these are the effects of tourism on Africa, drawing the line on how locals accept creativity and precarious work from black South Africans.</p>
            <p>The stereotypes surrounding Black South African creative workers are something that we wear like an albatross around our necks. What if we dare to be creative regardless of what has been defined as successful careers? Would a black parent in Kathehong accept that a purchase of a camera is an investment in the future career and exploration of creativity?</p>  
            <section class="pause" id="i"><a href="#i">Storytelling in picture form.</a></section>
            <p>Capturing life with photography around a big city like Johannesburg is storytelling in picture form. There is no difference between an editor of a newspaper or a TV presenter at SABC. All of us are in the business of curating life stories, be it digitally, or analog, still or motion, all being moments in time. </p>  <br>

            <p>
              Photographers, I would submit, should be more creative than ever, even though, along with the rest of the world, COVID-19 has dealt lethal blows on businesses. Truth be told, our profession has been under assault for many years now, long before COVID, with the diminution of rates paid for our services, and the evisceration of rights to the images we create.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            
            <p class="firstpara"><strong class="firstcharacter">M</strong>any newspapers have abandoned the notion of maintaining a staff, deeming it too expensive. Most magazines are a shell of what they once were if they continue to publish at all. Bleakness abounds. A photo editor of a major publication, in an interview not too long ago, offered sobering advice to young, would-be photojournalists. She counseled that it would be advisable to have a trust fund, should you try to do this job. We need to be creative, even more, besides all these attacks.</p>
