               <p style="text-align:justify">The era of new media, media art, or digital art has been characterized by the <i>importance of the way we send and receive messages, over the message itself</i>.
                Looking at satellite television for example, the audience of new media, then tweets and retweets about the show they watched.
                 In doing so, we comment, create memes, thus becoming information producers using the various affordances of technology. 
                 Society also develops new <i><b>languages</b> </i>, for example, the language of emojis. These societal developments further influence the new trajectories to be taken by the technologies developed for these societies.
               </p>
               <p style="text-align:justify">Borrowing from McLuhan’s theory we can deduce that any medium can cross the boundaries of its own content regardless of the conventions of that content.
                    This has a direct effect to the audience who reads the medium. This cements McLuhan’s argument that the media is fast becoming an extension of humanity (Levine and McLuhan, 1964). 
                    Borrowing from this theory, I concur that in the wake of the internet, exchange of products and services have been intensified and enhanced.
                     Making the actual use of the internet an extension of humanity. This raises questions about technological determinism. 
                     This is a theory that pursues an argument on the relationship between society and technology (Chandler, 2000). 
                     It is a reductionist theory that argues that technology shapes and propels our society’s social and cultural ecosystem as well as our history.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">"Looking at the medium as a message, makes other forms of media and their characteristics obsolete.
                 For example, the rise of mobile technology enhanced interpersonal communication, and that was the death of the phone booth along with privacy and anonymity (Euchner, 2016).
                  The internet has also become a platform of collaboration, dethroning the glamour of mass production. Looking at twitter as an example, platform as a medium allows for retweets, and tweets, which can be regarded as authorship and co-authorship.
                   Questions arise whether mass production can still be regarded as the main source of information. News headlines on SABC2 can a rise from a tweet trending during the day. On the other hand, a news headline on SABC2 can trend on tweeter, with nuanced engagements, covering a larger audience than the broadcast station. </p>

               <br>
               <p>Nelson Wardrip-Fruin was interested in the documents of the future.
                    Giving credit to Douglas Carl Engelbart, his questions of the early years of hyper texting we centered around: what you can do on the screen that you can also do on paper.
                     As a writer, the transposition of the original magazine layout on the screen was important. This ambition of breaking the restrictions of paper. 
                     The two basic concepts of hypertext were connectivity between words and relevant paragraphs, and the connectivity between words and related words.
                      (Director’s Cut: Ted Nelson on Hypertext, Douglas Englebart, Xanadu and More, 2018).</p>

                      <p>Hypertext, used in the wake of the computing era, can be defined as new media. Wardrip-Fruin aligns his argument to those of the early
                           1660’s software engineers like Nelson and Englebert, where separate pieces of text or pictures can be connected by links. New media hypertext, 
                           however, differs from Nelson’s original vision of hypertext in that we do not read hypertext the same way we read a novel, and browsing the Web 
                           is a different experience from reading a book or newspaper (Vandendorpe, 2009)</p>

                           <p>Looking at hypertext in the era of social media, we can propose questions about the technology being an extension of socio-cultural practices.
                                The ability to click on a link, tweet and retweet. Then click on the retweet and use it as a meme caption. 
                                 Hypertext is not just as an idea but as a matter of social practice (Barnet, 2013).</p>
