                        <p class="firstpara"><strong class="firstcharacter">D</strong>uring the hard lockdown necessitated globally by the runaway COVID-19 pandemic, events associated with photography have been relegated to the leisure category. With many people spending their times on smartphones, the affordances of image manipulation in software packaged or downloadable for these smartphones have dealt a hard blow to photographers and postproduction artists alike. </p>

            <p class="firstpara"><strong class="firstcharacter">W</strong>hile many industries globally can establish that it is perfectly ok to take a break during the lockdown periods, the sad reality is that being a precarious worker in the creative industry does not come with such luxuries. Bills need to be paid, SARS needs their tax, And Checker did not lower their prices. In fact, there has been an exponential spike in prices of basic commodities during the lockdown periods.
              <br> If your usual kinds of work — commercial photographer, wedding freelance photographer, whatever — is extra-slow during the lockdown months, the reduced income will dent your normal financial life. In this blog, I investigate how a little creativity and some hustling can repair the dent in your wallet.</p>
            
            <h2>Revisit portraits.</h2>
            <p>A natural next step for a wedding photographer is taking portrait shots. As families a being forced to spend time together, or someone is stuck somewhere in the Northern Cape, it might be high time to give some of your old clients a call. When people are reunited, whatever the cause may be, they will always want to capture those moments in still or motion picture.  These shoots tend to be short and sweet, and even if you just sell a few of the images, it can be a way to turn an otherwise lazy Sunday afternoon into a business venture. You might be surprised how many of your clients did not realize they wanted to sit for a portrait until you nudge them with a polite phone call. </p>  <br>

            <h2>Help a local photographer.</h2>
           
            <p>Look for second-shooter work. When an event is finally allowed, regardless of the reduced numbers per venue, those few participants might require extra shots that normal. Who wouldn’t want to capture an event and be captured in still imagery when the president allows you to go out once in three months!  photographers in your area might need a hand with a reliable second shooter. Hit up your contacts to see if anyone needs help with some of their events. The offer might be hugely helpful to a photog in a bind with too much work (yes, there is such a thing).</p>
