            <p class="firstpara"><strong class="firstcharacter">T</strong>his blog seeks to reflect and analyse the
                digital divide, its effect, nuances, and roots across different countries. I wish to put forward the
                question: with the growth of technology around the world, how is the information brought about this
                technology, disseminated, accessed and who does it favour? </p>
            <p>Based on the present data, it can be determined that there are clear issues present in the sharing of
                information. Currently, the demarcation of information is evident when one browses the internet. Users
                of the internet are group mainly to Europe, America or global. The homogenization of users to “global”
                becomes very problematic, especially when internet cultures are so diverse. This is a prime example of
                the Internet catering to first world countries. There are not just small differences, these are
                differences that create are shocking.</p>

            <p class="firstpara"><strong class="firstcharacter">T</strong>he notion of “information geography’’ reveals
                that the source and authenticity of information is mediated through network’s affordances and
                constraints that exist as separate entities. By jumping from a specific area as a source, to another
                area of consumption based on the distribution infrastructure, information becomes a mobile entity.
                Technology provides the means to drastically increase the depth of information gathering and
                dissemination. This gives us the ability to produce large-scale data collection structures that expands
                the consumer’s overall encyclopedism.</p>
            <p>Social media in this context is used to denote any technology that enables the collection, dissemination,
                and collating of knowledge over the web. In this sense, I understand the web as a medium for education,
                with positive and negative effects
                attached to it. </p>
            <section class="pause" id="i"><a href="#i">Distribution.</a></section>
            <p>In the twenty first century, the internet has been overarchingly influential in ho society develops
                communication, up to the rise of digital vernaculars like the language of memes. This is a testament to
                the accomplishments and influence that internet technologies has on society. In most countries, digital
                engagement is dependent on the accessibility of internet to communicate information effectively across
                various platforms. The number of users worldwide is influenced by the factor of affordability as service
                quality differs from one place to another. For example, Asia alone holds 42% of the world’s internet
                population. This is more than the combined number of users across Europa and North America. African
                countries support less users due to economic conditions such as a lower rate of income. There are of
                course other reasons that influence the level of internet participation around the world. The
                distribution of collaborative coding hosted by platforms such as GitHub enables publishers to expand and
                share projects with each other. Content producers are dependent on GitHub services to host websites or
                track changes across projects.</p> <br>

            <section class="pause" id="ii"><a href="#ii">Is Graham, right?</a></section>
            <p>The distribution of Internet access across countries is uneven. For example, Asia contains 42% of the
                world’s Internet users. Most countries in Europe have 80% or more Internet penetration, meaning 80% or
                more of the population have access to the Internet. In contrast, “over 20 sub-Saharan African countries
                have an Internet penetration of less than 10%”. The access to Internet has a direct correlation to the
                access to information. If a person does not have access to the Internet, they do not have access to all
                the information present on the Internet.</p>
            <p>Another issue of Internet access across countries is the cost of broadband. The paper states that the
                relative affordability of broadband is the biggest issue. For example, the cost of broadband in Europe
                may be expensive, but being able to afford broadband takes a few hours of work. An astonishing line in
                the paper explains that one year of a broadband subscription costs the equivalent of 50 years of work.

            <h2>Geographies of participation.</h2>

            <img src="../images/Geography+of+Top-Level+Domain+names.png" alt="geography of domains"/>
            <p class="firstpara"><strong class="firstcharacter">D</strong>omain names are measured as an indication of
                content produced. The paper analysed how many domain names are registered in each country. The majority
                of domain names are registered in Europe or North America. In America, there is approximately 1 domain
                name for every three Internet users, where Asia has one registered domain name for 40 Internet users.
                This is interesting as Asia has the largest population of Internet users. Analysing these numbers shows
                that just because a country has a large Internet population, there may not be a large amount of domain
                registrations. This shows that Europe and America are the largest producers of digital content. There is
                a large discrepancy between the intake of information and the production of information. </p>
            <section class="pause" id="i"><a href="#i">GitHub.</a></section>
            <img src="../images/0_9f5uMrKMjLbzEf7q.png" alt="github"/>
            <p>GitHub is a code hosting service that programmers use to publish code. North America and Europe count for
                a third of all GitHub users. The Middle East, North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa are home to fewer than
                1% of GitHub users. This shows that the contribution of developing programmes is disproportionality
                based in North America and Europe. Code development does not take place as much in the Middle East and
                Africa.</p> <br>

            <section class="pause" id="ii"><a href="#ii">Wikipedia</a></section>
            <p>Wikipedia is the world's largest and most used encyclopaedia. Looking at Wikipedia’s data gives a good
                indication of how information is shared. Wikipedia allows anyone with an Internet connection to
                contribute. Once again, North America is one of the largest contributors to Wikipedia. Other large
                contributors include Germany, the United Kingdom and France. The paper states that Africa’s
                contributions are so low that Hong Kong alone contributes more than the whole continent combined.</p>

                Africa. The content in the Freebase database and Geonames was analysed. It showed that the United States
                has the largest concentration in Freebase with 45%. Geonames has more content for the United States
                alone than the whole continent of Asia.</p>

            <p>
                It can be determined that countries that are impoverished are most affected by the digital divide.
                “Information is critical in facilitating productivity” [1]. If third world countries cannot get access
                to information, they cannot be as productive as first world countries. This assists in creating more of
                an economic divide amongst countries. The bridging of this digital divide will bridge communication gaps
                between different cultures. The illiterate people in third-world countries will benefit from increased
                access to information.
