            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p class="firstpara"><strong class="firstcharacter">A</strong>n interface metaphor is a set of user
                interface visuals, actions and procedures that exploit specific knowledge that users have previously
                gained from other websites. The purpose of the interface metaphor is to give the user knowledge in a
                simplistic format about how to interact with the user interface. They are designed to be similar to our
                own physical entities but also contain their own properties, for example, desktop metaphors and web
                portals. They can be based on an activity and object or a combination of both work with user’s knowledge
                to help them understand the unfamiliar. Examples of interface metaphors are the magnifying glasses that
                represent the “zoom in” function or folder icons to show where files are contained. These are used in
                most current operating systems; however, this technology is susceptible to change as computers become
                more advanced.</p>

            <p class="firstpara"><strong class="firstcharacter">T</strong>he down side to changing interface metaphors
                on a constant basis is that the owners of software with many users are reluctant to make big changes and
                their interfaces evolve permanently to keep their familiar look and familiarity. Software designers
                attempt to make applications easier to use for both novice and adept users by creating concrete
                metaphors that resemble the user’s real-world experiences. Continual technological improvement has made
                metaphors depict these real-world experiences more realistically to ultimately enhance interface
                performance.</p>

            <p>Metaphors are a pivotal part of language and thought. It appears not only in poetry and novels, but also
                in everyday speech about common matters. The characteristics of metaphor in language are the same that
                govern how metaphor works in an interface. Just as metaphors invisibly permeate everyday speech, they
                also occur throughout the interfaces that humans use and design.</p> <br>

            <p>Metaphoric comparisons and interface presentations do more than render static denotative correspondences.
                They have motivational and affective consequences for users. They interact with and frame users'
                problem-solving efforts in learning about the target domain. Metaphors have been employed to increase
                the initial familiarity of the target domain, but they have an inevitable further role to play. The
                ultimate problem that the user should solve is to develop an understanding of the target domain itself—a
                mental model. Interface metaphors should also be viewed as tools proffered to users for articulating
                mental models.</p>

            <p>User-interface metaphors are a widely used, but poorly understood, technique employed
                in almost all graphical user-interfaces. Although considerable research has gone into the
                applications of the technique, little work has been performed on the analysis of the concept
                itself. </p>
