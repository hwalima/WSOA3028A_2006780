            <p class="firstpara"><strong class="firstcharacter">I</strong>t is not a normal Joburg sighting for a
                64-year-old man like me to be seen around carrying the camera, especially in the poorer neighborhoods of
                Johannesburg. If only creatives could break free beyond
                these stereotypical boundaries. If only we could understand that gaming, photography, and dancing are
                not hobbies, but a means of professionally curating arts.</p>
            <p>Alice Mann, a renowned South African photographer captured the all-female drummies, as an effort to zoom
                the lens to South Africa’s underprivileged communities “This is part of my ongoing work exploring
                notions of femininity and empowerment
                in modern society,” Mann explains. “With my continued investigation into this subculture, I hope that
                these images can communicate the pride and confidence these girls have achieved through identifying as
                ‘drummies,’ in a context where
                they face many social challenges.”</p>

            <p class="firstpara"><strong class="firstcharacter">W</strong>hy did it seem natural for black South
                Africans to invite and allow Alice to take pictures in their community, and not fellow black
                photographers? I have been asked so many questions even on free fall
                shoots. Questions like “So what are you using the photos for?” Maybe these are the effects of tourism on
                Africa, drawing the line on how locals accept creativity and precarious work from black South Africans.
            </p>
            <p>The stereotypes surrounding Black South African creative workers are something that we wear like an
                albatross around our necks. What if we dare to be creative regardless of what has been defined as
                successful careers? Would a black parent
                in Kathehong accept that a purchase of a camera is an investment in the future career and exploration of
                creativity?</p>

            <p>Capturing life with photography around a big city like Johannesburg is storytelling in picture form.
                There is no difference between an editor of a newspaper or a TV presenter at SABC. All of us are in the
                business of curating life stories,
                be it digitally, or analog, still or motion, all being moments in time. </p> <br>

                Photographers, I would submit, should be more creative than ever, even though, along with the rest of
                the world, COVID-19 has dealt lethal blows on businesses. Truth be told, our profession has been under
                assault for many years now, long before COVID,
                with the diminution of rates paid for our services, and the evisceration of rights to the images we
                create.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p class="firstpara"><strong class="firstcharacter">M</strong>any newspapers have abandoned the notion of
                maintaining a staff, deeming it too expensive. Most magazines are a shell of what they once were if they
                continue to publish at all. Bleakness abounds. A
                photo editor of a major publication, in an interview not too long ago, offered sobering advice to young,
                would-be photojournalists. She counseled that it would be advisable to have a trust fund, should you try
                to do this job. We need to
                be creative, even more, besides all these attacks.</p>
