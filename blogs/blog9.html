                technology and vendor neutrality, inclusive, gender parity and racial recognition movements have lashed
                at tech giants for embedding racism in AI and algorithms. This is what is coined as the new Jim code,
                extending from the Jim Crow laws of slavery and racism.</p>

                nuanced ways in which modern technology creates, supports, and amplifies racism and white supremacy.
                From AI-judged beauty contests to genetic and biometric testing, AI seems to be embedded underlying
                tones of racial prejudices.</p>

            <p>As technology becomes increasingly ubiquitous and troubling tech incidents grow in number (like Google
                Photo labeling Black people as gorillas), more people are questioning the exalted status of technology
                in society. However, these incidents are still frequently perceived as ‘one-offs’ rather than symptoms
                of an underlying malaise.</p> <br>

            <p>These coded biases make it difficult, even if consumers try to, disregard the topic of racism. The first
                point of departure is what is racism. Dr Benjamin alludes to the fact that racism can occur without a
                primary intention to harm. To think of technology as comparison to laws, we can assume that an embedding
                of racism can exist, as much as it can exists in a country law, to prejudices, disadvantage.</p>

            <p>The author of a technology, in this case web technology might not necessarily sit down and craft a code
                or IA algorithm that they primarily intend to be racist, but they might ignore key factors in their
                UI/UX design, making the end user product discriminatory in nature. The techno altruism for example,
                might have designed AI to stratify surveillance for a good cause. But because algorithms like those
                which power facial recognition grow, they tend to segregate against minorities in the digital realm.</p>

            <p>How do we as designers and consumers reclaim our agency in the digital ecospheres? Dr. Benjamin, an
                Associate Professor of African American Studies at Princeton University and founder of the Just Data Lab
                brings to light how the topics of racism are brought into the digital ecospheres. It’s time for Tech to
                stop being racist. Darker skin absorbs lighter and therefore reflects less light, making it more
                difficult to detect with optical sensors and image processing software., they say. Some tech giants like
                Facebook have defended their soap dispensing machines as temperaturist since they all use infrared which
                measures heat.</p>
            <p>Scholars studying the intersection of technology and society, and those in technical fields looking for
                an outside critical understanding of their own work, will find it an important jumping-off point or a
                valuable resource to deepen their knowledge on understanding racism within their fields. Dr Benjamin’s
                work is more urgent and relevant than ever, given social reckonings with Black understandings of
                systemic racism following the murder of George Floyd in May 2020. </p>

            <p class="firstpara"><strong class="firstcharacter">I</strong>nstead of a revolutionary new theory, its
                major contribution may be in exposing these ideas to a broader audience and as a catalyst for deeper
                examinations of the technologies and situations that Benjamin touches on.</p>
            <section class="pause" id="i"><a href="#i">Iterative design.</a></section>
            <p>Someone who has no experience in creating, and testing, hardware and software, defaults to racism. Here
                is another theory. They either did not come up with enough testing scenarios or they did not include
                enough test data (or correct testing data) to ensure all skin tones were handled under different
                conditions which can contain an astronomical number of variables. To think that racism is somehow
                included in the developing of a product is not foolish. It is too expensive to fix an issue after it has
                been released, and it would be embarrassing to the team that missed such an obvious thing to test for.
                Although the hardware/software tech community is becoming more diverse, I think there is more room for
                improvement in terms of testing variables for future iterations.</p> <br>

            <section class="pause" id="ii"><a href="#ii">Conclusion.</a></section>
            <p>Benjamin questions the problematic idea that new technologies are morally superior to humans, due to
                their neutrality, objectivity, and lack of bias. Benjamin suggests that this popular discourse allows
                racism to reign through technologies with a lack of accountability for the systems and designers. She
                explains that the ‘New Jim Code’ is the implementation of new technologies that reflect and reproduce
                existing inequities, often promoted as more progressive than discriminatory systems of the past.</p>
