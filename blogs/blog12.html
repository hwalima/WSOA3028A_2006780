            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p class="firstpara"><strong class="firstcharacter">U</strong>ser interface (UI), and user experience
                (UX), designs are extremely important when developing a website, yet so often they are merely just an
                afterthought. This is problematic, as bad UI and UX instantly result in a bad site – no matter how good
                the content is. As such, in this blog post I critically analyse both my websites UI and UX. More
                specifically, I will start by defining each term, before moving on to look at the UI and UX I have
                implemented, critically reflecting on my decisions.</p>
            <img src="../images/user2.jpg" alt="Ui development  UI design"/>
            <p>My first point of departure will be taking the audience through my website experience. To do this,
                however, we must understand what UX is. UX is all about the functionality of the website, and the
                experience the user gets from using it. The particular focus is how users experience the site, and how
                easily they can perform the task they set out to achieve.</p>

            <h2>Considerations.</h2>

            <img src="../images/user3.png" alt="UI/UX" />
            <p class="firstpara"><strong class="firstcharacter">W</strong>ith that, we can then start to analyse my
                websites UX. The website has pursued to follow a user centric design, especially as concerning the color
                grading. To achieve this, my design was centre around two questions:
            </p>
            <section class="pause" id="i"><a href="#i">What are users trying to achieve when visiting the website?</a>
            </section>
            <section class="pause" id="i"><a href="#i">What are the affordances and constraints that makes point one
                    easy and possible, or difficult and impossible? </a></section>

            <p>Thus, I established two potential goals for users visiting my site – to offer an engaging experience with
                the character of James Dladla and his photography; in a way that invites the user to come back to the
                site and read more. </p>

            <section class="pause" id="i"><a href="#i">Experiencing the Blogs. </a></section>
            <p>Being aware that the blogs are mainly scholarly and academically structured, the question I asked is how
                to I make these blogs engaging, while avoiding thick blocks of texts and yet maintaining academic
                rigour.</p> <br>
            <p>The entry point for the website is the landing page, where the user is presented with an image courasel.
                This is a deliberate design to tell the user that the website is about photography. When my website
                users presented with the homepage, I accommodate their goals in two ways: </p>
            <section class="pause" id="i"><a href="#i">Presenting the user with a call-to-action button. This button
                    links to the page where the user can access James Dladla’s blogs giving quick access to the
                    engagement of my character with Johannesburg. </a></section>

            <section class="pause" id="i"><a href="#i">Giving access to my recent blog posts </a></section>

            <h2>Rationale.</h2>

            <p class="firstpara"><strong class="firstcharacter">U</strong>using these, I make the users experience as
                fluid as possible. However, in the case that the user has other goals, a persistent navigation bar, with
                clearly labelled items, is present – allowing for easy navigate across the entire site.
                In addition to this, there is the website’s UI. In general, UI consists of the visual design of the
                website – encompassing its look, presentation, and interactivity. This can most easily be identified
                through a websites colour choice, buttons, fonts, and more. I have made these colour choices, fonts, and
                layout consistent throughout all the gages to unify the
                website. For my UI, I chose to mainly rely on a minimalistic design, and colour scheme, for multiple
                reasons.

            <h2>James Dladla.</h2>

            <p class="firstpara"><strong class="firstcharacter">T</strong>he site has to portray the personality of
                James Dladla, a simple 64-year-old man who is a minimalist.
                This is further emphasised in the content of the website, simple writing and blogs that relate to simple
                life issues, like photography.
                By using a clean user interface, and grayscale, both James’s photography, and all other content across
                the site, are highlighted and accentuated.
                Notwithstanding its simplicity and minimalism, usability and accessibility remained at the core of the
                design.

            <h2>Conclusion.</h2>

            <p class="firstpara"><strong class="firstcharacter">I</strong>n conclusion, by first defining UI and UX, I
                was able to critically analyse my sites design. However, there are still shortcomings since some
                elements like layout and padding have not been sufficiently addressed by this analysis.
