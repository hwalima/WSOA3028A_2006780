                photographs, important photographersâ€™ studios, the uses of portraiture in the 19th century, and the
                current passion for portraits in Africa. They review a variety of topics, including what defines a
                common culture of photography, the social and political implications of changing technologies for
                portraiture, and the lasting effects of culture on the idea of the person depicted in the photographic
                image.

            <p>Since the 1990s, Questions of racial preference in photography have been raised, even up to a global
                scale. Photography works produced by Africans in Africa were regarded as secondary works of art in
                exhibitions. On the other hand, imagery works staged in Africa European or American photographer have
                been upheld as superior. </p>

            <p>This might be since the legacy of earlier writing on photography in Africa has produced certain tenacious
                misconceptions. In reply we have not produced a book about contemporary African art as currently
                marketed overseas. Instead, this anthology explores deeper and more pressing concerns about the social
                lives of images and the politics of representation in Africa and subjects them to systematic study.</p>

                There is therefore a greyed-out area between the putative poles of `digital democracy' and `digital
                literacy', questioning the communicative co-ordinates of the snapshot and identifying the `idiomatic
                genres' in which it takes place.

            <h2>The importance.</h2>

            <p class="firstpara"><strong class="firstcharacter">D</strong>igital cameras enable domestic photographers
                to take `good' or professional-looking photographs and make certain capacities of professional cameras
                available for consumer use. Conversely, however, they argue that the question of critical understanding
                of the politics of representation in domestic camera use remains, since technical proficiency is not
                necessarily always accompanied by analysis. One reason suggested for this is that, frequently, the uses
                of photography are insufficiently analysed. The article therefore criticizes the idea that (domestic)
                photography can be understood in terms of `language' without paying due attention to the use of
                photography to capture the nonverbal.</p>

            <p class="firstpara"><strong class="firstcharacter">T</strong>he presence of the digital camera in the
                global south, has been regarded as a case study in its own regard. Instead of matching the bearers of
                such a camera at par regardless of location, the picture becomes influential depending on where the
                photographer comes from.
            </p>
            <p>An example of this is explored in the context of apartheid South Africa during the 1980s through the
                work of a collective called Afrapix. This group's images of the repression of Black and Coloured
                populations by the apartheid regime, although largely curbed in South Africa, found an extensive
                international reception. These photographs contributed to the worldwide condemnation and sanctions that
                ultimately led to the collapse of the apartheid government. </p>

            <p>Among the various types of photographic image produced in Africa by African practitioners, the ID picture
                (or passport photo) has been the most widespread ever since the introduction of photography at the end
                of the 19th century. As far as photographers are concerned, the production of this kind of picture has
                always represented a major part of their workF</p>
