        <h3>The garden of forking paths.</h3>
        <p>The garden of forking paths by Jorge Borges (1962) creates an obscure twist to a story, where the reader
          keeps pondering what would occur next. “This is a detective story in which the reader is the detective”
          (Borges, 1962).</p>

        <h3>The ode to Geocities.</h3>
        <p>A space once existed, where many early web users teased out their relationship with the web. On logging on to
          GeoCities a 2D space opened, where your presence was represented as neighborhoods which you would hop into and
          become part of a community. This space set the foundation of blogging sites and social networking as we know
          it today, A space that James Dladla would have flourished in were it not for the digital divide.</p>

        <h3>What hypertext is-Noah Wardrip-Fruin.</h3>
        <p>Nelson Wardrip-Fruin was interested in the documents of the future. Giving credit to Douglas Carl Engelbart,
          his questions of the early years of hyper texting we centered around: what you can do on the screen that you
          can also do on paper. As a writer, the transposition of the original magazine layout on the screen was
          important.</p>

        <h3>The medium is the message.</h3>
        <p>The era of new media, media art, or digital art has been characterized by the importance of the way we send
          and receive messages, over the message itself. Looking at satellite television for example, the audience of
          new media, then tweets and retweets about the show they watched. </p>

        <h3>Impact of "The medium is the message".</h3>
        <p>In his academic work, Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man (1964), Marshall McLuhan changes the
          landscape of media, more so, mass media, by asserted that “the medium is the message” (McLuhan, 1964: pp7).

        <h3>User Interface.</h3>
        <p>UI designs usually use overarching theme colour style to show different information segments on the website.
          How then does the user knows what is important? Sharp colours difference might be used, but what about
          accessibility considerations. Some designs borrow from the Von Restorff Effect (1933) which is also known as
          the isolation effect. By isolating an item by colour, the design promotes the memory of that item.</p>
