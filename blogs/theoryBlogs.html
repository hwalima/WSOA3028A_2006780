                <p>A space once existed, where many early web users teased out their relationship with the web. On
                    logging on to GeoCities a 2D space opened, where your presence was represented as neighborhoods
                    which you would hop into and become part of
                    a community. This space set the foundation of blogging sites and social networking as we know it
                    today, A space that James Dladla would have flourished in were it not for the digital sectionide.</p>

                <p>Nelson Wardrip-Fruin was interested in the documents of the future. Giving credit to Douglas Carl
                    Engelbart, his questions of the early years of hyper texting we centered around: what you can do on
                    the screen that you can also do on paper.
                    As a writer, the transposition of the original magazine layout on the screen was important.

                <h3>The medium is the message.</h3>
                <p>The era of new media, media art, or digital art has been characterized by the importance of the way
                    we send and receive messages, over the message itself. Looking at satellite television for example,
                    the audience of new media, then tweets
                    and retweets about the show they watched. </p>

                <h3>Impact of "The medium is the message".</h3>
                <p>In his academic work, Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man (1964), Marshall McLuhan changes the
                    landscape of media, more so, mass media, by asserted that “the medium is the message” (McLuhan,
                    1964: pp7).

                <h3>User Interface.</h3>
                <p>UI designs usually use overarching theme colour style to show different information segments on the
                    website. How then does the user knows what is important? Sharp colours difference might be used, but
                    what about accessibility considerations.
                    Some designs borrow from the Von Restorff Effect (1933) which is also known as the isolation effect.
                    By isolating an item by colour, the design promotes the memory of that item.</p>

                <p>In the twenty first century, the internet has been overarchingly influential in ho society develops
                    communication, up to the rise of digital vernaculars like the language of memes. This is a testament
                    to the accomplishments and influence that internet technologies has on society.</p>

                <p>Studies have also shown that a more accessible website will attract larger audiences, require less
                    maintenance cost and achieve better search results (Abou-Zahra.2018).</p>
